## Summary of Sub-tasks

- **${subtask1_uuid}**: Analysis and Planning
- **${subtask2_uuid}**: Implementation
- **${subtask3_uuid}**: Testing and Documentation

## Detailed Description

$description

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All requirements are implemented according to specifications
- [ ] All tests pass successfully
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect changes
- [ ] Code review is completed and approved
- [ ] Changes are merged to main branch

## Workflow (TDD Approach)

### Initial Test Run

\`\`\`bash
# Initial test script
./scripts/run-tests.sh --scope=$category
\`\`\`

Initial test state saved in [.initial_test_state.log](.initial_test_state.log)

### Step 1: Write Tests

- [ ] Create test specifications for the improvement
- [ ] Implement test cases covering all acceptance criteria
- [ ] Verify tests fail as expected before implementation

### Step 2: Implementation

- [ ] Implement the required changes
- [ ] Follow project coding standards
- [ ] Add appropriate comments and documentation

### Step 3: Test and Validate

- [ ] Run tests to verify implementation
- [ ] Fix any issues identified during testing
- [ ] Perform manual verification if needed

### Step 4: Documentation

- [ ] Update relevant documentation
- [ ] Add examples and usage instructions
- [ ] Document any API changes

## TODO Checklist

- [ ] Analyze current implementation
- [ ] Design solution approach
- [ ] Implement changes
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Submit for review
- [ ] Address review feedback
- [ ] Merge changes
