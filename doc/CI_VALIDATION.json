      "content": "The validation protocol consists of three verification phases. First, a CI run is triggered with specific commit information and date tracking for traceability. Second, three verification points are assessed: test result files existence (checking for jest-results.json and vader-reports JSON files), summary content validation (confirming accurate test counts, proper failed test names, and absence of 'No test results found' messages), and error handling verification (ensuring proper failure on missing files and clear error messaging). Third, validation status is tracked through initial run status, discovered issues list, and root cause analysis when problems are found."

    {
      "title": "Next Steps",
      "priority": "HIGH",
      "tags": ["CI/CD", "Planning"],
      "content": "Four sequential actions must be completed to finalize the validation process: executing the initial CI validation to generate real test data, documenting the actual results with metrics and findings, implementing fixes for any discovered issues, and performing revalidation if corrections were necessary. This structured approach ensures that any problems in the CI pipeline are systematically identified and addressed before considering the validation complete."

      "title": "Notes",
      "priority": "MEDIUM",
      "tags": ["CI/CD", "Documentation"],
      "content": "The validation protocol emphasizes that completion requires examining real CI run output rather than theoretical or simulated results. Four specific requirements must be satisfied: obtaining logs from an actual CI run to ensure authenticity, verifying the existence and completeness of test result files, validating that summary content accurately reflects test execution, and confirming that error handling properly manages exceptional conditions. This rigorous approach ensures the CI pipeline delivers reliable quality metrics."
