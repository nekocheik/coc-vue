**Summary:** Comprehensive audit report detailing the status of TypeScript, Lua, and Vader tests across the coc-vue project, identifying failed tests and providing recommendations for improvement.

### Summary
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Tags:** Testing, Audit

The test audit reveals a mixed testing status across the coc-vue project. Statistical breakdown shows that out of 105 total tests, 96 are passing and 9 are failing. By language, Lua tests have the highest success rate with 90/90 passing, followed by Vader tests with 6/6 'empty' tests passing. TypeScript tests are entirely failing with 0/9 passing. This indicates strong Lua testing but significant issues in the TypeScript testing infrastructure.

### TypeScript Tests
**Priority:** HIGH
**Tags:** Testing, TypeScript

All TypeScript tests are currently failing due to syntax errors. Unit tests (5 files) and integration tests (4 files) consistently report 'Missing semicolon' errors when executed with Jest. These failures appear related to TypeScript configuration and Jest setup issues, particularly around export statements and ES modules formatting. Attempts to run tests with project-specific configurations also failed with 'No tests found' errors, suggesting potential path or module resolution problems in the test configuration.

### Lua Tests
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Tags:** Testing, Lua

The Lua testing suite performs exceptionally well with all 90 tests passing successfully. The main test runner (lua/test/run_tests.lua) executes all tests correctly, completing 112/112 assertions in approximately 0.71 seconds. Individual test files for components like Select also pass their tests, though they terminate with a non-fatal error message about 'attempting to index a boolean value' that doesn't affect the test results. The strong performance of Lua tests provides a solid foundation for core functionality verification.

### Vader Tests
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Tags:** Testing, Vader

The six Vader test files (button.vader, core_validation.vader, modal.vader, select.vader, select_old.vader, and simple.vader) execute without errors but report '0/0 tests passed'. This unusual result indicates that while the test files exist and can be processed by the testing framework, they contain no actual test cases to execute. The test script reports division by zero errors when calculating success percentages, further confirming the absence of actual test assertions in these files.

### CLI Commands
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Tags:** Testing, CLI

The project's command-line interface shows mixed functionality. Server management commands (server:start, server:stop) and basic log commands (logs:check) operate correctly. However, most test-related commands fail due to missing files, incorrect paths, or undefined functions. The ticket management system partially works, allowing ticket creation and listing, but status updates and deployment functions fail. The Vader test script is operational and successfully executes its workflow despite the empty test files.

### Issues and Recommendations
**Priority:** HIGH
**Tags:** Testing, Documentation

Four key areas require attention to improve testing reliability. First, TypeScript tests need configuration updates to properly handle TypeScript and ES modules. Second, CLI commands require path corrections and missing script creation. Third, Vader tests need actual test cases implemented within existing file structures. Fourth, while Lua tests function well, addressing the minor error about indexing boolean values would enhance test completion messages. Overall, using the successful Lua test structure as a model for other test types would bring consistency to the testing framework.

### Conclusion
**Priority:** HIGH
**Tags:** Testing, Audit

The coc-vue project demonstrates inconsistent testing quality across its components. While Lua tests exhibit excellent reliability with a 100% pass rate (90/90 tests), TypeScript tests completely fail due to configuration issues (0/9 passing). Vader tests technically pass but execute no actual test cases (6/6 'empty' tests). This mixed testing status requires focused effort on TypeScript configuration, Vader test implementation, and CLI command path corrections to achieve consistent testing quality across the entire project.
