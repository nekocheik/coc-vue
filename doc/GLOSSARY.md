# Technical Glossary
*Generated on 2025-05-22 13:26:34*

This glossary contains technical terms extracted from project documentation.

## ACTION
 Messages are categorized into seven distinct types through the MessageType enum: EVENT (component notifications), ACTION (operation requests), STATE (update notifications), SYNC (synchronization), REQUEST (data/action queries), RESPONSE (request replies), and ERROR (failure notifications).
*Source: BRIDGE_PROTOCOL.md*

## Actions
**Summary:** Comprehensive documentation on the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment configuration for the coc-vue project, including Docker environments, GitHub Actions workflows, test execution, and secret management.
*Source: CI_CD_INTEGRATION.md*

## Adapters
 Core TypeScript modules include Bridge (facilitating TypeScript-Neovim communication), Renderer (handling UI component display), Core Services (managing buffers and focus), Core Adapters (providing standardized Neovim interfaces), Core Components (implementing input fields), and Demo Implementations (showcasing usage patterns).
*Source: TECHNICAL_HANDBOOK.md*

## Adding
 Adding entirely new component types requires creating a Lua implementation, extending the VimComponent class in TypeScript, defining the message protocol between layers, implementing message handlers, and creating comprehensive tests.
*Source: BRIDGE_DOCUMENTATION.md*

## After
After successfully establishing the mirrored structure in '__tests__/', all original test files were systematically removed from the 'src/' directory to eliminate ambiguity and maintain codebase clarity.
*Source: TS_TEST_OVERHAUL.md*

## All
All cross-language communication uses a standardized BridgeMessage format containing six key fields: 'id' (component instance identifier), 'type' (message classification), 'action' (operation name), 'payload' (optional data container), 'timestamp' (optional tracking value), and 'correlationId' (optional request/response pairing).
*Source: BRIDGE_PROTOCOL.md*

## API
 The class handles the complexities of Neovim buffer management while presenting a clean, Vue-inspired API for component development.

## ASCII
 This example showcases six key features: reactive state tracking count and step values, computed properties (displayValue, stats) derived from state, comprehensive method API for interaction, watchers monitoring count changes, complete lifecycle hook implementation, and ASCII art buffer rendering with keyboard mappings (+ to increment, - to decrement, r to reset, q to close).

## Bidirectional
The extension provides six core capabilities: 1) Component-agnostic architecture supporting any Vue component without configuration, 2) Reactive system enabling real-time component interaction, 3) Dynamic mappings automatically generated from available methods, 4) Comprehensive testing suite ensuring reliability, 5) Simplified command-line interface for operations, and 6) Bidirectional communication between TypeScript and Lua layers.
*Source: README.md*

## Both
 Both systems are fully integrated into the CI/CD pipeline through GitHub Actions, creating a comprehensive testing ecosystem that validates both the TypeScript and Vim aspects of the extension.

*Source: BRIDGE_DOCUMENTATION.md*

## Buffer
 Buffer options provide extensive customization including name, filetype, dimensions (width/height), positioning ('floating', 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right'), content editability, and focus behavior.
*Source: BRIDGE_DOCUMENTATION.md*

## Build
The integration verification follows a six-step process: 1) Build and link the extension using npm commands, 2) Verify command registration by checking if the VueUISelect command is properly registered in Neovim, 3) Test direct command execution by running the VueUISelect command with component parameters, 4) Test COC command integration through the CocCommand vue.
