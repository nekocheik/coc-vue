    {
      "title": "Legacy Test Migration",
      "priority": "MEDIUM",
      "tags": ["Testing", "Migration"],
      "content": "The initial phase involved preserving original test logic while enabling implementation of an improved structure. All existing test files were relocated to a hidden '.legacy_ts_tests' directory with their original structure intact. This migration cataloged key testing components including package.json scripts (test, test:watch, test:integration, test:bridge), test runner scripts (run-unit-tests.sh, run-integration-tests.sh, run-all-tests.sh, watch-tests.sh), and Jest configurations (original and improved). Nine critical test files were systematically moved to maintain their historical value while clearing the path for structural improvements."
    },
    {
      "title": "Strict Mirrored Test Structure Implementation",
      "priority": "HIGH",
      "tags": ["Testing", "Architecture"],
      "content": "To ensure consistent maintainability, a strict mirrored test structure was implemented following a key principle: for every source file in 'src/<path>/<filename>.ts', a corresponding test file must exist at '__tests__/<path>/<filename>.test.ts'. This one-to-one mapping creates perfect directory alignment between source and test files. Seven test files were relocated from their original locations to this mirrored structure, while test utility files remained centralized in the '/helper-test/' directory. This reorganization established a transparent relationship between each source file and its corresponding test file."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cleanup of Old Test Files",
      "priority": "MEDIUM",
      "tags": ["Testing", "Maintenance"],
      "content": "After successfully establishing the mirrored structure in '__tests__/', all original test files were systematically removed from the 'src/' directory to eliminate ambiguity and maintain codebase clarity. The cleanup, executed on 2025-05-21 using 'find ./src -name \"*.test.ts\" -type f -exec rm -f {} \\;', eliminated all test files from source directories. This established the '__tests__/' directory as the single source of truth for all tests while preserving test execution integrity. Current coverage metrics (78.49% statements, 61.39% branches, 75% functions, 79.15% lines) fall slightly below the 80% target across all metrics, with specific improvement areas identified."
    },
    {
      "title": "New Test Structure Rules",
      "priority": "HIGH",
      "tags": ["Testing", "Standards"],
      "content": "The overhaul established five foundational rules for the testing framework: 1) Maintain a mirrored structure where each source file has a corresponding test file in '__tests__/', 2) Follow the '<filename>.test.ts' naming convention, 3) Centralize all test utilities, mocks, and contexts in the 'helper-test/' directory, 4) Organize tests using 'describe' blocks for logical grouping, and 5) Target comprehensive coverage of all public methods and edge cases. Tests can be executed using standard commands: 'npm test' for basic execution or 'npm run test:coverage' for detailed coverage metrics."
    },
    {
      "title": "Test Policy Enforcement & Commit Traceability",
      "priority": "CRITICAL",
      "tags": ["Testing", "CI/CD"],
      "content": "A robust test policy enforcement system with commit traceability was implemented to maintain code quality standards. The system, completed on 2025-05-21 in the 'test/hook-policy-validation' branch, introduced four validation scripts: check-test-location.js (verifies correct test file locations), check-test-coverage.js (ensures minimum coverage requirements), log-test-result.js (creates audit trails), and a primary pre-commit hook orchestrating all validation checks. This enforcement mechanism effectively blocks commits that would reduce test coverage below established thresholds."
    },
    {
      "title": "Coverage Improvement Focus",
      "priority": "HIGH",
      "tags": ["Testing", "Quality"],
      "content": "The current testing infrastructure targets 80% coverage across all metrics. Three priority areas require focused improvement: 1) The Select component (src/components/select.ts) with only 46.87% statement coverage, 2) Branch coverage in the main entry point (src/index.ts) at 60%, and 3) Overall function coverage across the codebase at 75%. Planned improvements include updating package.json scripts for the new Jest configuration, adding comprehensive tests for remaining TypeScript files, integrating the new structure with CI/CD pipelines, and updating documentation."
