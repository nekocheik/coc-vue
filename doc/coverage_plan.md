**Summary:** Detailed plan to achieve 100% test coverage across all code in the src/ directory, including current coverage metrics, specific uncovered code areas, proposed test cases, and progress tracking.

## Sections

### Current Coverage Status
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Tags:** Testing, Metrics

The initial test coverage assessment reveals significant gaps across the codebase. Overall metrics show 53.53% statement coverage, 30.88% branch coverage, 53.57% function coverage, and 54.72% line coverage. Key components have varying levels of coverage: index.ts (76.92% statements), bridge/core.ts (82.25% statements), bridge/index.ts (88.46% statements), components/select.ts (26.56% statements), components/vim-component.ts (38.88% statements), events/index.ts (92% statements), and reactivity/index.ts (76.19% statements). The components/select.ts file represents the most significant coverage gap in the codebase.

### Index.ts Test Plan
**Priority:** HIGH
**Tags:** Testing, Implementation

The main entry point file has several uncovered error handling sections that require attention. Specifically, line 40 (activation error handling), lines 64-66 (command registration error handling), lines 77-79 (bridge test command error handling), lines 129-131 (component destruction error handling), and lines 145-151 (deactivation error handling). Tests have been added to address these gaps, including mocked rejected promises from nvim.command, simulated errors during command registration, mocked bridge communication failures, and tests for components with and without destroy methods.

### Bridge Core Test Plan
**Priority:** HIGH
**Tags:** Testing, Implementation

The bridge/core.ts file has five key uncovered areas: line 78 (setupMessageReceiver error handling), lines 118-120 (receiveMessage error handling), lines 127-129 (processMessageQueue early return), lines 173-175 (unregisterHandler early return), and line 150 (processMessageQueue error handling). Four test cases have been successfully implemented: invalid JSON handling in receiveMessage, empty queue and concurrent processing tests for processMessageQueue, non-existent action tests for unregisterHandler, and comprehensive handler management tests. Two test cases remain to be implemented: setupMessageReceiver error handling and processMessageQueue error handling.

### Bridge Index Test Plan
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Tags:** Testing, Implementation

The bridge/index.ts file has achieved full coverage through the implementation of two critical test cases: non-string/non-object argument handling in sendCommand (using number and boolean arguments) and error handling in sendEvent (with simulated failures). These additions have successfully addressed all coverage gaps in this component, bringing it to 100% across all metrics (statements, branches, functions, and lines).

### Select Component Test Plan
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Tags:** Testing, Components

The components/select.ts file represents the most severe coverage gap with only 26.56% statement coverage. Numerous code sections require testing: lines 93-136 (methods and properties), line 149 (error handling), lines 186-227 (lifecycle methods), lines 240-249 (event handling), lines 280-284 (option selection), multiple error handling sections, UI rendering functions, state management, destruction processes, and cleanup routines. The test plan must systematically address component initialization with various configurations, lifecycle management, event processing, selection validation, rendering validation, state transitions, destruction processes, and error handling scenarios.

### Vim Component Test Plan
**Priority:** HIGH
**Tags:** Testing, Components

The components/vim-component.ts file has multiple uncovered areas: line 145 (error handling), lines 173-423 (component methods), and several error handling points throughout the code. Five primary test categories need implementation: error handling in component methods, lifecycle method validation, state management verification, interaction testing, and destruction process validation. Testing faces specific challenges including computed property implementation using Object.defineProperty, complex window management, reactivity system integration, buffer content updates requiring extensive Neovim API mocking, and error paths in buffer operations.

### Events and Reactivity Test Plan
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Tags:** Testing, Architecture

The events/index.ts file has achieved 100% coverage by addressing two key areas: error handling during event registration (testing events with no listeners) and error handling during event removal (testing listener removal from non-existent events). The reactivity/index.ts file has reached 93.33% statement coverage with key tests added for onStop callback execution, multiple stop calls on effects, property deletion in reactive objects, error handling, and lazy option validation. Three test cases remain to be implemented: early returns in the runner function when effects are inactive, cleanup function verification in watch implementations, and immediate option validation in watch operations.

### Progress Tracking and Next Steps
**Priority:** HIGH
**Tags:** Testing, Planning

Current coverage metrics show substantial improvement in some areas: src/events/index.ts (100% across all metrics), src/bridge/index.ts (100% across all metrics), src/bridge/core.ts (96.77% statements), and src/reactivity/index.ts (93.33% statements). However, src/components/select.ts remains problematic at 46.87% statement coverage. The overall project coverage appears to have decreased to 16.46% statements because more files are now included in the coverage report. Three priority next steps have been identified: implementing remaining tests for src/index.ts with emphasis on branch coverage, continuing improvement of src/components/select.ts coverage, and completing the remaining tests for src/reactivity/index.ts.
