      "content": "The Vue-like reactive component system creates a framework for developing, managing, and rendering reactive UI components in Neovim buffers with bidirectional state synchronization between TypeScript and Lua. The architecture consists of three core components: a Generic Bridge Core providing component-agnostic communication between layers, a Vue-Like Reactivity System implementing Vue 3's reactivity patterns in TypeScript, and a VimComponent Class delivering lifecycle hooks with buffer integration. This layered architecture enables seamless interaction between TypeScript functionality in COC.nvim and Lua execution in Neovim through JSON-RPC/IPC communication, with distinct responsibilities for each system component."

      "title": "Generic Bridge Core",
      "priority": "MEDIUM",
      "tags": ["Bridge", "Communication"],
      "content": "The bridge core establishes component-agnostic communication through a standardized BridgeMessage interface containing component identifier, message type, action name, optional payload data, optional timestamp, and optional correlation ID for request/response pairing. Five key features distinguish this implementation: complete absence of hardcoded component logic in the bridge layer, standardized message protocol for all communications, bidirectional information flow between TypeScript and Lua, sophisticated handler registration system for message routing, and comprehensive error handling for robust operation. This bridge maintains separation between communication mechanisms and component-specific implementations."

      "title": "Vue-Like Reactivity System",
      "priority": "HIGH",
      "tags": ["Reactivity", "Technical"],
      "content": "The reactivity system implements Vue 3-style state management with four core mechanisms: reactive objects tracking property access and modifications, computed properties automatically updating when dependencies change, effects executing when reactive state changes (equivalent to Vue's watchEffect), and watchers responding to specific state transitions. This pattern enables developers to create reactive state with the reactive() function, define computed values derived from state, establish effects for automatic execution upon state changes, and implement watchers responding to specific property transitions. State updates automatically trigger all dependent computations, effects, and watchers, ensuring consistent UI state."

    {
      "title": "VimComponent Class",
      "priority": "CRITICAL",
      "tags": ["Components", "Implementation"],
      "content": "The VimComponent class combines Vue-like programming patterns with Vim buffer integration through comprehensive lifecycle hooks (beforeMount, onMounted, onUpdated, onBeforeDestroy, onDestroyed), reactive state triggering automatic re-rendering, computed properties with dependency tracking, callable methods from both languages, watchers responding to state changes, and seamless Vim buffer integration. Components are instantiated with configuration including ID, type, state, and lifecycle hooks, then managed through mount(), updateState(), and destroy() methods. This class simplifies complex Neovim buffer management while presenting a clean, Vue-inspired API for component development."

    {
      "title": "Buffer Integration",
      "priority": "MEDIUM",
      "tags": ["UI", "Integration"],
      "content": "Components render to Vim buffers functioning as the DOM equivalent for the UI system. Buffer options provide extensive customization including name, filetype, dimensions (width/height), positioning ('floating', 'top', 'bottom', 'left', 'right'), content editability (modifiable, readonly), and focus behavior. The buffer subsystem delivers five essential capabilities: comprehensive buffer lifecycle management (creation, updating, destruction), flexible window positioning (floating or split windows), granular buffer option configuration, efficient content rendering from component state to buffer content, and keyboard mapping setup for component interaction. This buffer-centric approach leverages Neovim's native display capabilities."

    {
      "title": "Counter Component Example",
      "priority": "MEDIUM",
      "tags": ["Components", "Examples"],
      "content": "The Counter component demonstrates the system's capabilities through complete implementation: creation with configuration (ID, initial count, step size), mounting, method invocation (increment, decrement, reset, setStep), and cleanup. This example showcases six key features: reactive state tracking count and step values, computed properties (displayValue, stats) derived from state, comprehensive method API for interaction, watchers monitoring count changes, complete lifecycle hook implementation, and ASCII art buffer rendering with keyboard mappings (+ to increment, - to decrement, r to reset, q to close). The component effectively demonstrates how the architecture translates to concrete interactive interfaces."

    {
      "title": "Usage and Testing",
      "priority": "MEDIUM",
      "tags": ["Development", "Testing"],
      "content": "Creating new components follows a six-step workflow: defining component options (ID, type, state, methods, computed properties, watchers, hooks, render function), creating component instance by extending VimComponent, mounting it with await component.mount(), updating state through component.updateState(), invoking methods via await component.callMethod(), and cleaning up with await component.destroy(). The system includes comprehensive testing for Bridge Core (bidirectional communication), VimComponent (lifecycle, reactivity, buffer integration), and concrete implementations like the Counter component. This design creates modular components (self-contained and composable), reactive behavior (automatic UI updates from state changes), testable architecture, and extensible framework for new component creation."
