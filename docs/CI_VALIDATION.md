# CI Validation Protocol

## Purpose
This document tracks the validation of CI test reporting accuracy and reliability.

## Validation Steps
1. **Trigger CI Run**
   - Commit: [commit message here]
   - Date: [validation date]

2. **Verification Points**
   - Test result files presence:
     - `test-results/jest-results.json`
     - `.ci-artifacts/vader-reports/*_results.json`
   - Summary content:
     - Actual test counts
     - Failed test names
     - No "No test results found" messages
   - Error handling:
     - Proper failure on missing files
     - Clear error messages

3. **Validation Status**
   - Initial run: [pending]
   - Issues found: [list any issues]
   - Root cause: [analysis if issues found]

## Next Steps
- [ ] Run initial CI validation
- [ ] Document actual results
- [ ] Fix any issues found
- [ ] Revalidate if fixes were needed

## Notes
The CI validation must be completed with real CI run output before considering the fix complete. The protocol requires:
1. Actual CI run with logs
2. Verification of test result files
3. Validation of summary content
4. Error handling verification
