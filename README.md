## 🚀 Vue.js in Neovim Like Never Before

Coc-Vue transforms Neovim into a true Vue.js development environment, offering an interactive and reactive experience directly in your editor. Manipulate Vue components, test their behavior, and develop faster thanks to this advanced integration.

### ✨ Key Features

- **100% Agnostic Architecture** - Works with any Vue component without specific configuration
- **Reactive System** - Real-time interaction with your Vue components
- **Dynamic Mappings** - Automatically generated based on available methods
- **Robust Testing** - Comprehensive test suite ensuring reliability and stability
- **Unified CLI** - Simple command line interface for all operations
- **Bidirectional Communication** - Seamless integration between TypeScript and Lua

## 💻 Innovative Architecture

The extension is built on a sophisticated client-server architecture with bidirectional communication between TypeScript (Node.js) and Lua (Neovim):

### Bridge Communication Protocol

At the core of coc-vue is a robust bridge that enables seamless communication between the TypeScript and Lua layers. This protocol implements the following message types:

1. **Component Management**
   - Load and initialize Vue components dynamically
   - Unload components when they're no longer needed
   - Maintain component lifecycle (mount, update, destroy)

2. **Method Invocation**
   - Call methods on Vue components from Neovim
   - Pass arguments and receive results
   - Handle asynchronous operations

3. **State Management**
   - Get and set component state
   - Update component properties
   - Synchronize state between TypeScript and Lua

4. **Event Handling**
   - Register event listeners
   - Emit events from components
   - Process user interactions

### Agnostic Component Architecture

The architecture has been completely refactored to be component-agnostic:

- **Dynamic Method Detection**: Automatically detects and implements standard component methods
- **Automatic Property Mapping**: Adds methods to components based on their properties
- **Component Discovery**: Implements multiple search strategies to find Vue components
- **Unified API**: Harmonized method calls across the codebase

This design allows the extension to work with any Vue component without requiring hardcoded references or specific configurations.

## 🧪 Testing Framework

### Comprehensive Test Suite

The project includes a robust testing framework that ensures reliability and stability. The test suite is designed to be modular, allowing developers to run specific test sections based on their needs.

### Selective Test Execution

```bash
# Run all component tests
make test-component

# Run a specific test section
./scripts/test/runners/run-component-tests.sh --section component-loading

# Run tests progressively (section by section)
./scripts/test/runners/run-component-tests.sh --progressive
```

### Available Test Sections

| Test Section | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `component-loading` | Tests for loading components (valid and invalid) |
| `component-state` | Tests for getting component state |
| `dropdown-control` | Tests for opening/closing the dropdown |
| `option-selection` | Tests for selecting options |
| `props-update` | Tests for updating component properties |
| `multi-select` | Tests for multi-select mode |
| `navigation` | Tests for navigating through options |
| `error-handling` | Tests for error handling |
| `cleanup` | Tests for unloading components |

## 🧩 Component Library

### Select Component

The Select component is a fully-featured dropdown selector that can be used in both single and multi-select modes. It provides a rich API for interacting with the component:

#### Core Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `open()` | Open the dropdown menu |
| `close()` | Close the dropdown menu |
| `focus_option(index)` | Focus a specific option by index |
| `focus_next_option()` | Focus the next option in the list |
| `focus_prev_option()` | Focus the previous option in the list |
| `select_option(index)` | Select an option by its index |
| `select_current_option()` | Select the currently focused option |
| `select_by_value(value)` | Select an option by its value |
| `confirm()` | Confirm the current selection |
| `cancel()` | Cancel the selection and close the menu |
| `update_options(options)` | Update the list of available options |
| `set_disabled(disabled)` | Enable or disable the component |

## 💻 Server Operations

### Starting the Command Server

The extension uses a command server to handle communication between TypeScript and Lua. To start the server:

```bash
# Start the Node.js command server
./scripts/test/runners/run-command-tests.sh --node
```

The server will start on `127.0.0.1:9999` and log all commands and responses for monitoring and debugging purposes.

### Running Command Tests

To verify that the command server is functioning correctly, you can run the command tests:

```bash
# Run the command tests against the server
make test-command

# Or directly using the script
./scripts/test/runners/run-command-tests.sh
```

This script performs the following operations:
1. Starts the command server in the background
2. Runs all the command tests against the live server
3. Displays the test results and server logs for analysis
4. Automatically cleans up the server process when done

## 🔧 Debugging

### Checking Errors in Neovim

When encountering issues with the extension, it's important to check for errors in Neovim. Use the following commands:

```vim
:messages       " Display Neovim error messages
:CocOpenLog     " Open the Coc.nvim log file
```

These commands are essential for identifying problems during test execution or development. Always check these logs if you encounter unexpected behavior.

### Common Troubleshooting

- **"Component not found" error**: Ensure that the component has been properly loaded before attempting to interact with it.
- **Server connection issues**: Verify that port 9999 is not already in use by another process.
- **Asynchronous errors**: If asynchronous operations don't complete correctly, use the `--detectOpenHandles` option with Jest to identify the issues.
- **Bridge communication failures**: Check both TypeScript and Lua logs to identify where the communication is breaking down.

## 👨‍💻 Development

The coc-vue extension is built with a modular architecture that makes it easy to extend with new components and features. The current implementation provides a stable foundation for communication between TypeScript and Lua, with a robust bridge for bidirectional messaging.

### Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Make your changes to the TypeScript or Lua code
4. Build the extension with `npm run build`
5. Test your changes with `npm test`

### Adding New Components

Thanks to the agnostic architecture, adding new components is straightforward:

1. Create a new component class in `src/components/`
2. Implement the required methods and properties

## 🎫 Ticket-Based Development

We use a structured ticket-based workflow for all development tasks. This ensures that all changes are properly tracked, tested, and documented.

### Ticket Categories

Tickets are organized into the following categories:

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `feat` | New features or enhancements | Adding a new component |
| `ui` | User interface components | Improving component styling |
| `structure` | Code structure improvements | Refactoring the test directory |
| `ci` | CI/CD pipeline enhancements | Adding code coverage reporting |
| `docs` | Documentation improvements | Updating API documentation |
| `test` | Testing infrastructure | Adding new test cases |
| `perf` | Performance optimizations | Improving component rendering |

### Ticket Workflow

1. **Create a ticket** for your task using the CLI:
   ```bash
   ./coc-vue-cli.sh ticket:create [category] [priority] [title]
   ```
   Example: `./coc-vue-cli.sh ticket:create feat 90 "Add Modal Component"`

2. **Follow the workflow** defined in the ticket template:
   - Each category has a specific workflow tailored to that type of task
   - Complete each step in the workflow before moving to the next
   - Update the ticket status as you progress

3. **Update ticket status** as you work:
   ```bash
   ./coc-vue-cli.sh ticket:status [uuid] [status]
   ```
   Example: `./coc-vue-cli.sh ticket:status a88cf6d1 in-progress`

4. **Deploy to GitHub Issues** for team tracking:
   ```bash
   ./coc-vue-cli.sh ticket:deploy [uuid]
   ```
   This creates a GitHub issue with all the ticket details and links it to your local ticket.

5. **List all tickets** to see what's in progress:
   ```bash
   ./coc-vue-cli.sh ticket:list
   ```

For more detailed information on the ticketing system, see [TICKETING.md](docs/TICKETING.md).
3. Register the component in the component registry

No hardcoded references are needed - the extension will automatically detect and implement the component's methods.

## 🧪 Testing and Quality Assurance

The project maintains a comprehensive test suite to ensure stability, reliability, and correctness. The tests are organized into different categories for better maintainability and faster execution.

### Running Tests

You can run tests using the Makefile for a more streamlined experience:

```bash
# Run unit and integration tests
make test

# Run all tests (unit, integration, component, command, ping)
make test-all

# Run specific test categories
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-component
make test-command
make test-ping

# Run tests with verbose output
make test VERBOSE=true

# Run tests with custom timeout
make test TIMEOUT=600

# Clean up test resources
make clean
```

Alternatively, you can use the test scripts directly:

```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/test/run-all-tests.sh

# Run unit tests only
./scripts/test/run-all-tests.sh --unit-only

# Run with verbose logging
VERBOSE_LOGS=true ./scripts/test/run-all-tests.sh
```

### Simplified Testing

If you encounter issues with the standard test suite (such as Neovim connection problems), you can use the simplified test runner that uses mocks instead of real Neovim connections:

```bash
# Run all tests with mocks (more reliable)
./scripts/test/runners/run-simplified-tests.sh
```

The simplified test runner offers several advantages:

- **No Neovim dependency**: Tests run without requiring a real Neovim instance
- **Faster execution**: Mocked tests run significantly faster
- **More reliable**: Eliminates connection and timing issues
- **Consistent results**: Provides the same results across different environments

### Test Categories

| Category | Description | Standard Command | Simplified Command |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Unit Tests** | Tests for individual functions and classes | `npm test` | Included in simplified tests |
| **Integration Tests** | Tests for component interactions | `npm run test:integration` | Included in simplified tests |
| **Bridge Tests** | Tests for TypeScript-Lua communication | `npm run test:bridge` | Mocked in simplified tests |
| **Component Tests** | Tests for Vue components | `./coc-vue-cli.sh test:component` | Included in simplified tests |
| **End-to-End Tests** | Tests for complete workflows | `./coc-vue-cli.sh test:e2e` | Not available in simplified tests |

### Troubleshooting Tests

If you encounter issues with tests, try the following steps:

1. **Clean up resources**: Run `make clean` to remove temporary files and free ports
2. **Use simplified tests**: Run `./scripts/test/runners/run-simplified-tests.sh` to use mocked tests
3. **Check logs**: Examine `/tmp/component-server.log` for server-related issues
4. **Increase timeout**: Use `MAX_TIMEOUT=600 ./scripts/test/run-all-tests.sh` for longer tests

### Code Quality

The project uses several tools to maintain high code quality:

- **TypeScript** for static type checking
- **ESLint** for code style and quality
- **Jest** for testing
- **Webpack** for bundling

## 📦 Docker and Continuous Integration

The project includes Docker configuration for testing and continuous integration with both GitLab and GitHub.

### Docker Testing

Run tests in an isolated Docker environment:

```bash
# Run simplified tests with Docker
./scripts/run-docker-tests.sh

# Or use Docker Compose directly
docker-compose up test

# Run full tests (may fail)
docker-compose up test-full
```

### GitHub CI Integration

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration:

```bash
# Set up GitHub CI integration
./scripts/setup-github-ci.sh

# Monitor workflow runs
gh run list
```

The GitHub workflow:
- Runs on pushes to main/master branches and pull requests
- Builds and runs tests in Docker containers
- Uploads test results as artifacts
- Handles secrets securely

### GitLab CI Integration

The project also includes a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file for GitLab CI/CD:

- **Build**: Compiles the project and generates artifacts
- **Test Simplified**: Runs tests with mocks (should always succeed)
- **Test Full**: Runs complete tests (optional, may fail)
- **Deployment**: Creates a package for deployment (on tags and master branch)

### Managing Secrets

Sensitive information is handled securely:

- Local secrets are stored in `.env` files (excluded from version control)
- CI secrets are stored in GitHub/GitLab secret storage
- See [TESTS.md](TESTS.md) for detailed instructions on managing secrets

### Customizing the Docker Environment

You can customize the Docker environment by modifying these files:

- `Dockerfile`: Docker image configuration
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker services configuration
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`: GitHub CI configuration
- `.gitlab-ci.yml`: GitLab CI configuration

For detailed documentation on testing with Docker and CI integration, see [TESTS.md](TESTS.md).

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### In-Editor Debugging

If you encounter issues while using the extension, these Neovim commands will help you diagnose the problem:

```vim
:messages       " Display Neovim error messages
:CocOpenLog     " Open Coc.nvim log file
:CocCommand workspace.showOutput vue  " Show Vue extension output
```

### Advanced Diagnostics

The extension provides comprehensive diagnostic tools:

```bash
# Check all logs
./coc-vue-cli.sh logs:check all

# Check specific component logs
./coc-vue-cli.sh logs:check select

# Analyze recent errors
./coc-vue-cli.sh logs:analyze errors

# Generate diagnostic report
./coc-vue-cli.sh diagnostics:report

# Clean up test ports and processes
make clean
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Component not loading | Check that the component file exists and is properly exported |
| Bridge communication errors | Verify that both TypeScript and Lua services are running |
| Method not found | Ensure the component implements the method you're trying to call |
| Performance issues | Check the logs for slow operations and consider optimizing |
