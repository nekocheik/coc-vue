**Summary:** Overview of the COC-VUE documentation structure, providing links to various documentation sections including developer guides, component documentation, and technical references.

## Sections

### Overview
**Priority:** HIGH
**Tags:** Documentation, Architecture

COC-VUE delivers Vue.js integration for COC.nvim, combining TypeScript core logic with Lua-based Neovim integration to create interactive UI components and features. The architecture implements a component-agnostic design that eliminates hardcoded component references, enabling dynamic component loading without global file modifications. This approach allows keyboard mappings to be automatically configured based on available component methods, creating a flexible and extensible framework for Neovim UI development.

### Documentation Structure
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Tags:** Documentation, Organization

The documentation is organized into three primary categories. General Documentation includes comprehensive developer guides and testing information. Component Documentation focuses on specific components like the Select component, covering both integration procedures and testing methodologies. Technical Documentation provides in-depth information about the architecture, including the TypeScript-Lua bridge implementation, bridge protocol specifications, details of the reactive component system, and a complete technical handbook for reference. This multilayered structure ensures that documentation addresses the needs of users with different expertise levels and information requirements.

### Getting Started
**Priority:** HIGH
**Tags:** Documentation, Onboarding

New users and developers should begin with the Developer Documentation, which provides a comprehensive overview of the project's architecture, structure, and key components. Those interested in specific component implementation can reference component-specific documentation for detailed information about integration and testing procedures. For deeper technical understanding, the technical documentation section offers detailed insights into the underlying architecture and communication protocols. This progressive approach helps users navigate the documentation based on their specific needs and technical expertise.
